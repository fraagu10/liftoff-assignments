For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
 The main idea of our application is to be able to come up with recipes to cook to suit the needs of an individual who is either short on time, cooking ingredients, or just in general cooking knowledge. Users will find many things useful in our app as they will be able to query recipes based on ingredients currently present in their pantry/fridge. The app will let you know immediately what you can make with what you have available and also recommend more recipes based on how close you are to completing a set list of ingredients for another recipe. 
 The idea for this application came from a need of new ideas on foods to cook. In other occassions there has been times where I would like to finish everything in my fridge before going grocery shopping again, something like this would come in handy.

### Features
Search - Users will be able to search for recipes based on a few questions and inputs.

Favorites Fearute - Users will be able to save recent searches or new ones into custom made recipe lists.

Dietary Information/Chart - User will be able to see nutritional facts about the meal they looked up and information of food they have consumed throughout that day.

User Profile - User will be able to create a profile to save all their lists, keep track of food that user has consumed with nutritional information, share recipes, export recipes.

### Technologies
Front End
    Angular 8
        -JavaScript
    Bootstrap CSS
Back End
    Spring Boot
    Firebase SAAS (Maybe)
    SQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
The use of an API in order to pull nutritional information and recipe directions is something that we will need to try to learn to use so that some of the functionalities of our program can be initilized. We will also need to include a database feature to make our web app persistent. Possibilities for this include Spring Boot or perhaps Firebase SAAS. Both require some looking into as to what might work better for the project.
